            <li><strong>Developed</strong> robust scalable microservices and
                BFFs in FastAPI within a hexagonal architecture, using the best
                practices in development and testing. This resulted in a more
                agile and reliable, yet flexible and extensible application,
                capable of supporting continuous growth.</li>

            <li><strong>Developed</strong> scalable text processing APIs using
                Flask and FastAPI, integrating NLP algorithms to enhance data
                processing capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Achieved</strong> a 50% reduction in API response times
                by redesigning the database architecture and migrating to a more
                efficient backend framework (FastAPI).</li>
            <li><strong>Created</strong> a performance dashboard that
                facilitated data-driven decision-making and optimized
                operational workflows.</li>
            <li><strong>Implemented</strong> RPA algorithms for efficient data
                extraction, benefiting both internal processes and external
                partnerships.</li>
            <li><strong>Onboarded</strong> new web developers, providing
                training and support in JavaScript frameworks (Next.js, Vue.js,
                Nest.js), enhancing team productivity and cohesion.</li>
